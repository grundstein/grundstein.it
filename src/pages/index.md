# grundstein?

@grundstein is our approach to hosting infrastructure and maintenance.

This is the entry page for the documentation. It is very much Work in Progress.

it is (currently in the process of being) purpose built for the
[magic](https://magic.github.io) jamstack generator.

### our goals

reproducible and verifiable builds, down to the kernel.

minimal dependencies on all layers, all services custom built.

free (as in freedom) and open source toolchain.
